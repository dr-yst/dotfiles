Yasobjc is a tool for yasnippet snippet generation for objective-c library (cocoa/iphone SDK).

Basic Usage: yasobjc.rb -o DIR file1 file2 ...

-o DIR: The output directory for the snippets generated

Example: find /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS4.0.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks -name "*.h" | xargs yasobjc.rb -o ~/.emacs.d/yasnippet/text-mode/cc-mode/objc-mode

which will generate all snippets into standard yasnippet directory.

One snippet is generated per objective-c function, and the snippets are categoried by header file name. For example, all functions inside "NSString.h" will be in "NSString" category.

It's recommended to use ETAGS plus auto-complete library for better completion experience.
